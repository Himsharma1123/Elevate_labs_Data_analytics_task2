# Supermarket Sales Dashboard â€“ Task 2 (Data Analyst Internship)

## Task Objective
I created a Power BI dashboard using a supermarket sales dataset to derive key business insights related to sales, profit, customer behavior, and product performance.

## Dashboard Summary
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance across branches, customer demographics, and product lines. It enables interactive filtering by branch, gender, product line, and more.

## Key Visualizations
| Visual                          | Insight Gained |
| **KPI Cards**                   | Displayed Total Sales, Quantity, Gross Income, and Ratings |
| **Sales Trend Over Time**       | Visualized how sales evolved daily across the dataset timeline |
| **Sales by Branch**             | Compared total sales for Giza, Cairo, and Alex branches |
| **Gross Income by Product Line**| Highlighted which product categories earned the most profit |
| **Sales by Gender**             | Showed sales split: ~60% Female, ~40% Male |
| **Sales by Customer Type**      | Members contributed more sales (~59%) than Normal customers |
| **Rating vs Sales**             | Scatter plot revealed no strong linear correlation |
| **Payment Method Distribution** | Fairly balanced: Cash (34.7%), Ewallet (34%), Credit Card (31%) |
| **Slicers**                     | Enabled filtering by branch, gender, and product line |

## Key Insights

- **Branch Giza** achieved the highest total sales, followed by Alex and Cairo.
- **Health and Beauty** and **Home & Lifestyle** product lines generated the most gross income.
- **Female customers** contributed slightly more to total sales.
- **Member customers** were more valuable in terms of purchase behavior.
- Sales are **evenly distributed among payment methods**, with no clear dominance.
- Ratings did not significantly influence sales volume in this dataset.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI Desktop**
- Dataset: `cleaned_superMarket_salesData_fixed.csv` (uploaded manually)
- Final Output: `Supermarket_sales_dashboard.pdf`

## How I Built It
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset (checked date formatting, data types).
2. Created multiple visuals using card, bar, line, pie, and scatter charts.
3. Ussed slicers for interactive filtering across visuals.
4. Designed layout to maintain clarity and storytelling flow.
5. Exported the dashboard to PDF.
